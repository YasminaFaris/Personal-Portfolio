# Yasmina's Portfolio ðŸŒ¸

Hi! This is my personal portfolio site.  
I'm a student at King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, learning Python, Java, and Web Development.  
This site is a fun place to track my progress toward becoming a software engineer!

âœ¨ Built with HTML, CSS, and good vibes.
