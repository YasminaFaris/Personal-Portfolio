    <h1>Hey, Iâ€™m Yasmina ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br />
        I'm currently an <strong>IT student</strong> at
        <strong>King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang</strong>.<br />
        This site is mostly just for fun - a place to keep track of my projects, growth, and maybe laugh at my older code one day ðŸ« 
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, Iâ€™m learning and building with <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>,
        and some basic <strong>HTML/CSS</strong>.<br />
        My big goal? To become a software engineer
        who builds cool, useful things and keeps learning every step of the way.
  </p>
  <p>Thanks for stopping by (<em>even if you're just future me</em>)! ðŸ’»</p>
